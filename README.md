This module is to create a VPC, Sub-nets and routes for your standard AWS VPC pattern. It also implements the common-tag scheme and calculates the breakdown of your CIDR.
This module defaults to creating 3 private sub-nets and public sub-nets, or optionally less.

## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source       = "JamesWoolfenden/vpc/aws"
  version      = "0.1.21"
  cidr         = var.cidr
  zone         = var.zone
  common_tags  = var.common_tags
  account_name = var.account_name
}
```

Using these as your values in your terraform tfvars file:

```YAML
account_name = "test"
cidr         = "10.0.0.0/21"
zone         = ["A","B","C"]
common_tags={
    AccountType=           "Management"
    Application=           "base"
    Environment=           "Management"
}
```
